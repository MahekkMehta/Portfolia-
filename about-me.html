                    <h4>Hi, I am Mahek Mehta, a second-year AIML student with a passion for exploring the endless possibilities of technology.<br> 
                        I am presently pursuing a degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) at VIIT, with a growing interest in coding and technology
                        I own intermediate coding skills and am enthusiastic about making use of my expertise to real-world projects. I am proficient in Python and have hands-on experience in web development, specifically in HTML and CSS.
                        During my diploma, I developed a Blood Point website as a major project, which included both frontend and backend development using HTML, CSS, and PHP. Additionally, I have created my own personal portfolio website to show my skills and projects. Beyond programming, I have a interest in graphic design, including logo creation, and I am continuously working to improve my abilities in design as well as coding. While I'm not an expert in prompt engineering, I have a solid foundation and enjoy exploring this area further.
                        In addition to my technical skills, I am passionate about personal growth and learning.</h4>
